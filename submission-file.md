## Introduction to Application

Your Flutter-based "Sleep Talk Detector" app utilizes cutting-edge Voice Activity Detection (VAD) technology to identify any speech during sleep. Specifically designed for those curious about their nocturnal utterances or for sleep research purposes, this innovative application continuously monitors sounds while users are asleep. Once it detects speech, the dream talk will be record, enabling users to review what they might have said during the night. Easy to use, the app features a simple interface where users can start monitoring with just a tap before bed. In the morning, users can view a timestamped log of all speech events and play the audio, along with their transcriptions. This not only provides fascinating insights into one's sleep behavior but also aids those studying sleep disorders. By integrating robust VAD with reliable speech recognition technology, the Sleep Talk Detector offers a unique tool for exploring the mysteries of sleep talking.
